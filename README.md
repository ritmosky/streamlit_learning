# streamlit_learning



Streamlit is a faster way to build and share data apps.
It turns data scripts into shareable web apps in minutes. All in pure Python. No front‑end experience required

Streamlit’s open-source app framework is a breeze to get started with. It’s just a matter of:
$ pip install streamlit
$ streamlit hello

Build an app in a few lines of code with a magically simple API. Then see it automatically update as you iteratively save the source file.



# WHAT ABOUT THIS REPO


This mini project, which is also an introduction to streamlit, aims to visualize data relating to the use of UBER in New York City.

Streamlit has therefore made it possible to display in a rather web-oriented format with map maps but also histograms.
The python file contains the code that was used to set up the site. So it is better to launch it with Streamlit. The data used come from a database accessible online and containing data from 2014-09-01 to 2019-09-30.

Ordering is simple. You must first place it in the folder containing the file and then launch it with the terminal: streamlit run file_name.py
